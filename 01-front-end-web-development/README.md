## How Does the Internet Actually Work
- Internet is just a long piece of wire, and the wire connects different computers to each other.
- Servers are computers that are online usually 24 hours to serve  you all the data and files you are requesting when you try to access websites.
- Clients are the ones we use to access internet.
- A Web Server is like a giant library that's open 24/7, you can go there any hour of the day and request I want to see google's homepage, then serves you with all the files and datas you will need to view that websites you requested.
- Internet Service Provider (ISP) are the ones you pay to access internet. example: ATNT, comcast
- IP Address is a unique identify or postal address of every devices/computer.
- Domain Name Systems(DNS) Server is just like a phonebook find the IP address of the website you are trying to access.
- Internet Backbone is literally the backbone of the internet, that shows the cables of the servers connected to each other.

Client (Browser) -> Internet Service Provider -> DNS -> Google Server

## How Do Websites Actually Work
Code Files
1. **HTML** is for body structure like headings, images buttons, and etc.
2. **CSS** is responsible for styling web site. Styling an elements like adding colors, changing font style, size and even animations.
3. **JavaScript** can do things, it can add behavior to the websites, rathen than just displaying text or styling. Button Click functionality is one example of javaScript event.

Google webiste analogy: When we received the files from Google server, the browser load the **HTML** files to see the structure of the website. Then when we received **CSS** it will modify the appearance of all those components. Finally when we received the **JavaScript** files, then the website will start having behavior.
