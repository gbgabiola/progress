## Where to Begin?

The language itself.

- The human mind is made for **language**.
- It's our super power; it comes naturally.
- Parents don't have to "teach" children how to speak.
- Let's use this strength to our advantage.


## Language Environment

|  English  | JavaScript  |
| :-------: | :---------: |
|   Home    | Web Browser |
| Workplace |   Node.js   |
|           |   MongoDB   |


## Too many teachers make the mistake of ...

- Having you begin by memorizing environmental jargon.
- Skipping over the language itself; syntax & structure.
- Underestimating you, your intellect, and your attention span.
- Thinking you need to build a "click me I'm a button" app immediately.
- Thinking you can't understand abstract ideas.

Your mind was made for **language** so **leverage that**.
