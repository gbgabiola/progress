# The 10 Days of JavaScript: The Language Itself

## Day 1: Getting Started

No prior programming knowledge is required.
If you've never heard of **JavaScript** this is the perfect place to get started.

JavaScript is bigger than the web browser.

**String** is a text like name, word, sentence or even paragraph wrap in a single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.


For now focus on the equal sign, quotes, periods, and mathematical symbols because those are the skeleton in the core of the javaScript language itself.

It's the aspect that never changes regardless of environment.

**variable** is a name where we store the value


## Day 2: Functions

What is a function?

Function is an action words, in English a function would be a verb.

To call a function you simple type the name of the action/function including a bit of data inside the pair of parentheses.

**Argument** is a technical name for a piece of data that we pass along.

To create a function, we can start with function word then a space and then our own function name with a parentheses after that we include a pair of curly brackets.

**Parameter** is a variable name inside the function definition.
