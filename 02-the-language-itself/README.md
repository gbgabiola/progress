# The 10 Days of JavaScript: The Language Itself

## Day 1: Getting Started

JavaScript is bigger than the web browser.

**String** is a text like name, word, sentence or even paragraph wrap in a single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

For now, focus on the equal sign, quotes, periods, and mathematical symbols because those are the skeleton in the core of the javaScript language itself.

It's the aspect that never changes regardless of environment.

**Variable** is a name where we store the value.


## Day 2: Functions

### What is a function?

**Function** is an action words, in English a function would be a verb.

To call a function you simple type the name of the action/function including a bit of data inside the pair of parentheses.

**Argument** is a technical name for a piece of data that we pass along.

To create a function, we can start with function word then a space and then our own function name with a parentheses after that we include a pair of curly brackets.

**Parameter** is a variable name inside the function definition.


## Day 3: Objects

### Why we would use objects?

We would use objects to write a code to see that there is a relationship between the variables/functions.

### What is an object?

**Object** is a container so we can store whatever we want inside it. It contains properties and methods.

**Property** is a variable inside the object.

To add another property we need to separate them with a comma (`,`).

To access the property value of an object, we call the object name then dot (`.`) then the name of the property.

**Method** is the technical name we use for a function inside an object.

Browsers `document` object is one of the most useful objects.

`document` object represents the webpage as a whole meaning it contains all sorts of properties and methods.

`document` object has a method named `addEventListener` that accepts two (2) arguments, an event keyword and a function that we want to run everytime this event happens.

**Note**: Don't include a pair of parentheses right after the function name inside the `addEventListener` so we won't run, call or execute the function right away. Instead we are just passing along the name/reference to the function and it's up to the web browsers `addEventListener` method to know when to call this function.
