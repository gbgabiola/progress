## What is The HTML Boilerplate
- **Boilerplate** is a code template that can be reuse for each different project.
- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`** to use the latest version of html which is _HTML5_.
- **`<html>`** is the one that indicates that everything inside of it is html.
- **`<head>`** holds the information about webpage, and tells how it should handle the page.
  - **`<title>`** it to display the title of the webpage on the tab of the browser.
  - **`<meta>`** 
    - **charset="UTF-8"** using the standard encoding to display the page correctly. `UTF-8` uses all the characters around the world.
    - description
    - keywords
    - author
    - viewport

## How to Structure Text in HTML
- **`<p>`** element represents a paragraph text.
- **`<em>`** element marks text that has stress emphasis. Use `<em>` instead of `<i>` to convey more meaning on the subject.
- **`strong`** element gives text strong importance, and is typically displayed in bold. Use `<strong>` instead of `<b>` to give a strong importance to the subject.

## HTML Lists
- **`<ul>`** element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bullet list.
- **`<ol>`** element represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a number list.

## HTML Image Elements
**`<img>`** element represents an image in the document and it's a _self-closing_ tag

```html
<img src="genesis.png" alt="genesis-profile">
```
