## Introduction to HTML

- HyperText <u>Markup</u> Language
- tag must be close when you open it except for some tags.
- **`<h1>` - `<h6>` elements** represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the largest heading level and `<h6>` is the smallest heading level.

### The Anatomy of an HTML Tag

- HTML with _Start_ and _End_ tag
- HTML with _Self-closing_ tag
- HTML with _Attributes_

#### HTML element with Start and End tag

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```
- `<h1>` is the _Start_ tag.
- `Hello World!` is the _Content_.
- `</h1>` is the _End_ tag.

`<br>`
- element produces line break in text.

### What is The HTML Boilerplate

- **Boilerplate** is a code template that can be reuse for each different project.
- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`** to use the latest version of html which is _HTML5_.
- **`<html>`** is the one that indicates that everything inside of it is html.
- **`<head>`** holds the information about webpage, and tells how it should handle the page.
  - **`<title>`** it to display the title of the webpage on the tab of the browser.
  - **`<meta>`** 
    - **charset="UTF-8"** using the standard encoding to display the page correctly. `UTF-8` uses all the characters around the world.
    - description
    - keywords
    - author
    - viewport

- **`<p>`** element represents a paragraph text.
- **`<em>`** element marks text that has stress emphasis. Use `<em>` instead of `<i>` to convey more meaning on the subject.
