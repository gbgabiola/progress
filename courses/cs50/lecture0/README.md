# Lecture 0 - Scratch

Learned in this lesson using bullets:
* introduce to binary
* use the bulbs for binary
* see ASCII characters
* computing RGB colors
* Abstraction
* Pseudo Code, english like syntax
* practice a good Algorithm, step by step instructions to solve the problem
* Introduce Scratch programming
* operative verbs or action words = functions
* every decisions like if and else is an answer to a question which is boolean true or false
* explored `pick up`, `open`, and `look` are equivalent to **functions** in code, like verbs or actions that allow us to do something
* explored conditions like `if`, `else if`, and `else` are decisions based on answers to certain questions
* questions are called **Boolean expressions** which have an answer of either true or false.
* noticed that with one bit, we can represent true, with on, or 1, and false, with off, or 0.
