## Computer Programming

### Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation

- **JavaScript** is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
- A **programming language** typically includes ways to store data in computer memory, manipulate that data, organize code and run code repeatedly. I learnt how to do all of that in JavaScript via:
  - **Variables**: how to declare variables, assign, re-assign, and local vs. global scope.
  - **Data** types: numbers, booleans, strings, arrays, and objects.
  Functions: how to group code into functions, pass arguments to them, and return values from them.
  - **Conditionals**: how to use if/else statements and logical expressions.
  - **Loops**: how to use while and for loops to repeat code.
- **ProcessingJS** is the "library" we used to make a drawing & animation.
- **Library** is a collection of functions that other programmers created, and those functions know how to draw pixels into a canvas on the page. Examples:
  - **Shapes**: like `rect()`, `ellipse()`, and `line()`
  - **Colors**: like `fill()`, `stroke()`, and `background()`
  - **Text**: like `text()` and `textSize()`
  - **Events**: like `draw()` and `mousePressed()`
  - **Math**: like `random()` and `dist()`
