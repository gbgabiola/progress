## Computer Programming

### Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation

- **JavaScript** is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
- A **programming language** typically includes ways to store data in computer memory, manipulate that data, organize code and run code repeatedly. I learnt how to do all of that in JavaScript via:
  - **Variables**: how to declare variables, assign, re-assign, and local vs. global scope.
  - **Data** types: numbers, booleans, strings, arrays, and objects.
  Functions: how to group code into functions, pass arguments to them, and return values from them.
  - **Conditionals**: how to use if/else statements and logical expressions.
  - **Loops**: how to use while and for loops to repeat code.
- **ProcessingJS** is the "library" we used to make a drawing & animation.
- **Library** is a collection of functions that other programmers created, and those functions know how to draw pixels into a canvas on the page. Examples:
  - **Shapes**: like `rect()`, `ellipse()`, and `line()`
  - **Colors**: like `fill()`, `stroke()`, and `background()`
  - **Text**: like `text()` and `textSize()`
  - **Events**: like `draw()` and `mousePressed()`
  - **Math**: like `random()` and `dist()`

### Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages

- **Web** is a network of computers that have websites. 
  - **Server** is a computer that serves the website.
  - website is made of three languages:
    - **HTML** for marking up the website content
    - **CSS** for styling the website
    - **JavaScript** for making it interactive
  - **Browser** is an application used to access website.
    - Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera, Internet Explorer, & etc...
  - **Clients** are the ones we used to open a browser and access websites.
    - Computer, Laptop, iPad, Tablet, iPhone, Smartphones, etc...
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
  -  tags, starts (`<element>`) and ends (`</element>`) with angle bracket (`< >`).
  - inside the html includes head tag and body tag
  - head tag does't show on the page
  - The closing tag always comes after the content of the tag - it's how the browser knows that you want the tag to end.
  - The contents of an HTML tag are the stuff that goes between the opening and closing tags.
  - Any content that is visible on the web page should go between the opening `<body>` tag and the closing `</body>` tag
  - Headings are based on most important to least important, `<h1>` to `<h6>`
  - `<p>` tag is used to make paragraph.
  - browser ignores line breaks and whitespace, use `<br>` to render a line break
  - <em> is used to emphasize the word/s, `<strong>` will make the word/s bold to stand out
  - `<li>` to make a list inside of `<ul>` for unordered list or `<ol>` for ordered list
  - `<img>` to add image, `src` attribute to add/source the url of the image and `alt` attribute to add image description
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML
  - **selector** is the way of CSS to style html elements and are case sensitive
  - css declaration starts with selector followed by curly braces (`{` and `}`), property and values are declared inside
  - **element selector** are tag names without brackets (`<` and `>`)
  - `color` property specifies the color of text
    - `RGB` color value is specified with: `rgb(red, green, blue)`.
  - `background-color` property sets the background color of an element.
  - **id selector** is came from one of the html elements with an attribute of `id="nameOfId"`, **Note**: ID should be unique
  - **class selector** is came from one of the html elements with an attribute of `class="nameOfClass"`, classes can be repeated to a number of elements to style them in the group
