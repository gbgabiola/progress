# [ES6: Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/declare-a-read-only-variable-with-the-const-keyword)

`let` is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the `const` keyword.

`const` has all the awesome features that `let` has, with the added bonus that variables declared using `const` are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with `const`, it cannot be reassigned.

```js
"use strict"
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs"; // returns error
```

As you can see, trying to reassign a variable declared with `const` will throw an error. You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the `const` keyword. This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant. A common practice when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with words separated by an underscore.

---

Change the code so that all variables are declared using `let` or `const`. Use `let` when you want the variable to change, and `const` when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with `const` to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.

```js
function printManyTimes(str) {
  "use strict";

  const SENTENCE = str + " is cool!";
  for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i+=2) {
    console.log(SENTENCE);
  }
}
printManyTimes("freeCodeCamp"); // freeCodeCamp is cool!
```
