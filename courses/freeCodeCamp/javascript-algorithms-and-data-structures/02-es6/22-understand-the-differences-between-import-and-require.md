# [ES6: Understand the Differences Between import and require](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/understand-the-differences-between-import-and-require)

In the past, the function `require()` would be used to import the functions and code in external files and modules. While handy, this presents a problem: some files and modules are rather large, and you may only need certain code from those external resources.

ES6 gives us a very handy tool known as _import_. With it, we can choose which parts of a module or file to load into a given file, saving time and memory.

Consider the following example. Imagine that `math_array_functions` has about 20 functions, but I only need one, `countItems`, in my current file. The old `require()` approach would force me to bring in all 20 functions. With this new `import` syntax, I can bring in just the desired function, like so:

```js
import { countItems } from "math_array_functions"
```

A description of the above code:

```js
import { function } from "file_path_goes_here"
// We can also import variables the same way!
```

There are a few ways to write an `import` statement, but the above is a very common use-case.

**Note**  
The whitespace surrounding the function inside the curly braces is a best practice - it makes it easier to read the `import` statement.

**Note**  
The lessons in this section handle non-browser features. `import`, and the statements we introduce in the rest of these lessons, won't work on a browser directly. However, we can use various tools to create code out of this to make it work in browser.

**Note**  
In most cases, the file path requires a `./` before it; otherwise, node will look in the `node_modules` directory first trying to load it as a dependency.

Add the appropriate `import` statement that will allow the current file to use the capitalizeString function. The file where this function lives is called `"string_functions"`, and it is in the same directory as the current file.

## Setup
```js
"use strict";
capitalizeString("hello!");
```

## Solution
```js
"use strict";

import { capitalizeString } from "string_functions";

capitalizeString("hello!");
```
