# [ES6: Mutate an Array Declared with const](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/mutate-an-array-declared-with-const)

The `const` declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript.

Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using `const` by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use `let`.

However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using `const` are still mutable. Using the `const` declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

```js
"use strict";
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3]; // throws error, trying to assign a const
s[2] = 45; // works just as it would with an array declared with var or let
console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]
```

As you can see, you can mutate the object `[5, 6, 7]` itself and the variable s will still point to the altered array `[5, 6, 45]`. Like all arrays, the array elements in `s` are mutable, but because `const` was used, you cannot use the variable identifier `s` to point to a different array using the assignment operator.

An array is declared as `const s = [5, 7, 2]`. Change the array to `[2, 5, 7]` using various element assignment.

## Setup
```js
const s = [5, 7, 2];
function editInPlace() {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  s = [2, 5, 7]; // <- this is invalid
  // change code above this line
}
editInPlace();
```

## Solution
```js
const s = [5, 7, 2];
function editInPlace() {
  "use strict";

  // using sort
  s.sort();
  
//   s[0] = 2;
//   s[1] = 5;
//   s[2] = 7;
}
editInPlace();
```
