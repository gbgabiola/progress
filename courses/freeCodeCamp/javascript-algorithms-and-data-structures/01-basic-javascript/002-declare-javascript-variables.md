# Basic JavaScript: Declare JavaScript Variables

In computer science, _data_ is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides seven different _data_ types which are `undefined`, `null`, `boolean`, `string`, `symbol`, `number`, and `object`.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number `12`, and `strings`, such as `"12"`, `"dog"`, or `"123 cats"`, which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

_Variables_ allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.

`Variables` are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer `variables` differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

We tell JavaScript to create or _declare_ a variable by putting the keyword `var` in front of it, like so:

```js
var ourName;
```

creates a `variable` called `ourName`. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.

`Variable` names can be made up of numbers, letters, and `$` or `_`, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

Use the `var` keyword to create a variable called `myName`.

**Hint**  
Look at the `ourName` example if you get stuck.

```js
var myName;
```
