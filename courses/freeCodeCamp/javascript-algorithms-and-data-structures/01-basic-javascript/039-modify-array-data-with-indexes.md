# [Basic JavaScript: Modify Array Data With Indexes](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/modify-array-data-with-indexes)

Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are _mutable_ and can be changed freely.

**Example**

```js
var ourArray = [50,40,30];
ourArray[0] = 15; // equals [15,40,30]
```

**Note**  
There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.

```js
// Setup
var myArray = [18,64,99];

// Only change code below this line.
myArray[0] = 45; // myArray now equals [45,64,99].
```
