# [Basic JavaScript: Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-do---while-loops/)

You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The next type of loop you will learn is called a " `do...while` " loop because it first will " `do` " one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then it runs " `while` " a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true. Let's look at an example.

```js
var ourArray = [];
var i = 0;
do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

This behaves just as you would expect with any other type of loop, and the resulting array will look like `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. However, what makes the `do...while` different from other loops is how it behaves when the condition fails on the first check. Let's see this in action.

Here is a regular while loop that will run the code in the loop as long as `i < 5`.

```js
var ourArray = []; 
var i = 5;
while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
```

Notice that we initialize the value of `i` to be 5. When we execute the next line, we notice that `i` is not less than 5. So we do not execute the code inside the loop. The result is that `ourArray` will end up with nothing added to it, so it will still look like this `[]` when all the code in the example above finishes running.

Now, take a look at a `do...while` loop.

```js
var ourArray = []; 
var i = 5;
do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

In this case, we initialize the value of `i` as 5, just like we did with the while loop. When we get to the next line, there is no check for the value of `i`, so we go to the code inside the curly braces and execute it. We will add one element to the array and increment `i` before we get to the condition check. Then, when we get to checking if `i < 5` see that `i` is now 6, which fails the conditional check. So we exit the loop and are done. At the end of the above example, the value of `ourArray` is `[5]`.

Essentially, a `do...while` loop ensures that the code inside the loop will run at least once.

Let's try getting a `do...while` loop to work by pushing values to an array.

---

Change the `while` loop in the code to a `do...while` loop so that the loop will push the number 10 to `myArray`, and `i` will be equal to `11` when your code finishes running.

```js
// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```
