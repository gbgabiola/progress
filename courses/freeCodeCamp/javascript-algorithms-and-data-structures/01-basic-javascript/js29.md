# [Basic JavaScript: Find the Length of a String](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/find-the-length-of-a-string/)

You can find the length of a `String` value by writing `.length` after the string variable or string literal.

`"Alan Peter".length; // 10`

For example, if we created a variable `var firstName = "Charles"`, we could find out how long the string `"Charles"` is by using the `firstName.length` property.

Use the `.length` property to count the number of characters in the `lastName` variable and assign it to `lastNameLength`.

```js
// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
```
