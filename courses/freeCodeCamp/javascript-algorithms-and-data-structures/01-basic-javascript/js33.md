# [Basic JavaScript: Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-last-character-in-a-string)

In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if `var firstName = "Charles"`, you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using `firstName[firstName.length - 1]`.

Use _bracket notation_ to find the last character in the `lastName` variable.

```js
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
```
