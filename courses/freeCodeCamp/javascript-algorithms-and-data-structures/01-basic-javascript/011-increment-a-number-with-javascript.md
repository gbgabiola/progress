# [Increment a Number with JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/increment-a-number-with-javascript/)

You can easily _increment_ or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

```js
i++;
```

is the equivalent of

```js
i = i + 1;
```

**Note**  
The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

---

Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.

## Setup

var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;
```

## Solution

```js
myVar++; // 87
```
