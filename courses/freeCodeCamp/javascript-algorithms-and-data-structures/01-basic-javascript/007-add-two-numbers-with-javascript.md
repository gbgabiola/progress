# [Add Two Numbers with JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/add-two-numbers-with-javascript/)

`Number` is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the `+` symbol as addition operation when placed between two numbers.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15
```

---

Change the `0` so that sum will equal `20`.

## Setup

```js
var sum = 10 + 0;
```

## Solution

```js
var sum = 10 + 10;
```
