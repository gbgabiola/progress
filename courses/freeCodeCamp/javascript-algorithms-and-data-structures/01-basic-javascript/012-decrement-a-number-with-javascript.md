# [Decrement a Number with JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/decrement-a-number-with-javascript/)

You can easily _decrement_ or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.

```js
i--;
```

is the equivalent of

```js
i = i - 1;
```

**Note**  
The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

---

Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.

## Setup

```js
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar - 1;
```

## Solution

```js
myVar--; // 11
```
