# [Basic JavaScript: Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/multiply-two-numbers-with-javascript/)

We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `*` symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169
```

---

Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.

```js
var product = 8 * 10; // 80
```
