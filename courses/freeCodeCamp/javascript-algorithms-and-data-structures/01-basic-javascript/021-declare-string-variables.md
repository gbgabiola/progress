# [Declare String Variables](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/declare-string-variables/)

Previously we have used the code

`var myName = "your name";`

`"your name"` is called a _string literal_. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes. */

Create two new `string` variables: `myFirstName` and `myLastName` and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

## Solution

```js
var myFirstName = "Genesis";
var myLastName = "Gabiola";
```
