# [Basic JavaScript: Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/create-decimal-numbers-with-javascript/)

We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as _floating point_ numbers or _floats_.

**Note**  
Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in _floating point_. This can lead to rounding errors. [Details Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems).

Create a variable `myDecimal` and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. `5.7`).

```js
var myDecimal = 5.7;
```
