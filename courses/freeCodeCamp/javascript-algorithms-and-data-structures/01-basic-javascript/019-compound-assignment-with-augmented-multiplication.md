# [Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-multiplication/)

The `*=` operator multiplies a variable by a number.

`myVar = myVar * 5;`

will multiply `myVar` by `5`. This can be rewritten as:

`myVar *= 5;`

---

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `*=` operator.

## Setup

```js
var a = 5;
var b = 12;
var c = 4.6;

// Only modify code below this line

a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;
```

## Solution

```js
a *= 5; // 25
b *= 3; // 36
c *= 10; // 46
```
