# [Basic JavaScript: Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/subtract-one-number-from-another-with-javascript/)

We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the `-` symbol for subtraction.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6
```

---

Change the `0` so the difference is `12`.

```js
var difference = 45 - 33; // 12
```
