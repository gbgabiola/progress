# [Basic JavaScript: Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/divide-one-number-by-another-with-javascript/)

We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol for division.

**Example**

```js
myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8
```

---

Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.

```js
var quotient = 66 / 33; // 2
```
