# [Basic JavaScript: Decrement a Number with JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/decrement-a-number-with-javascript/)

You can easily _decrement_ or decrease a variable by one with the `--` operator.

`i--;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i - 1;`

**Note**  
The entire line becomes `i--;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.

```js
var myVar = 11;

myVar--;
```
