# [Basic JavaScript: Understanding Boolean Values](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/understanding-boolean-values)

Another data type is the _Boolean_. `Booleans` may only be one of two values: `tru`e or `false`. They are basically little on-off switches, where `true` is "on" and `false` is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.

**Note**  
`Boolean` values are never written with quotes. The `strings` `"true"` and `"false"` are not `Boolean` and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

Modify the `welcomeToBooleans` function so that it returns `true` instead of `false` when the run button is clicked.

```js
function welcomeToBooleans() {
    
return true;
}
```
