# [Basic JavaScript: Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-plus-operator/)

In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a `String` value, it is called the _concatenation_ operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by _concatenating_ them together.

**Example**

`'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'`

**Note**  
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Build `myStr` from the strings `"This is the start. "` and `"This is the end."` using the `+` operator.

```js
var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
```
