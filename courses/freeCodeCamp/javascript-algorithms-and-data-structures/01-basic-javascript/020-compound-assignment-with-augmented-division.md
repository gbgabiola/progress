# [Compound Assignment With Augmented Division](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-division/)

The `/=` operator divides a variable by another number.

`myVar = myVar / 5;`

Will divide `myVar` by `5`. This can be rewritten as:

`myVar /= 5;`

---

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `/=` operator.

## Setup

```js
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

// Only modify code below this line

a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;
```

## Solution

```js
a /= 12; // 4
b /= 4; // 27
c /= 11; // 3
```
