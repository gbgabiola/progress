# [Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Division](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-division/)

The `/=` operator divides a variable by another number.

`myVar = myVar / 5;`

Will divide `myVar` by `5`. This can be rewritten as:

`myVar /= 5;`

---

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `/=` operator.

```js
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

a/=12;
b/=4;
c/=11;
```
