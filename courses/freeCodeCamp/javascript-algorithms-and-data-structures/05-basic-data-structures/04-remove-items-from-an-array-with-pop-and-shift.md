# [Basic Data Structures: Remove Items from an Array with pop() and shift()](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/remove-items-from-an-array-with-pop-and-shift)

Both `push()` and `unshift()` have corresponding methods that are nearly functional opposites: `pop()` and `shift()`. As you may have guessed by now, instead of adding, `pop()` removes an element from the end of an array, while `shift()` removes an element from the beginning. The key difference between `pop()` and `shift()` and their cousins `push()` and `unshift()`, is that neither method takes parameters, and each only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.

Let's take a look:

```js
let greetings = ['whats up?', 'hello', 'see ya!'];

greetings.pop();
// now equals ['whats up?', 'hello']

greetings.shift();
// now equals ['hello']
```

We can also return the value of the removed element with either method like this:

```js
let popped = greetings.pop();
// returns 'hello'
// greetings now equals []
```

---

We have defined a function, `popShift`, which takes an array as an argument and returns a new array. Modify the function, using `pop()` and `shift()`, to remove the first and last elements of the argument array, and assign the removed elements to their corresponding variables, so that the returned array contains their values.

## Setup
```js
function popShift(arr) {
  let popped; // change this line
  let shifted; // change this line
  return [shifted, popped];
}

// do not change code below this line
console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete']));
```

## Solution
```js
function popShift(arr) {
  let popped = arr.pop(); // ["complete"]
  let shifted = arr.shift(); // ["challenge"]
  return [shifted, popped];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete'])); // (2)Â ["challenge", "complete"]
```
