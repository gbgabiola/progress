# [Basic Data Structures: Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/use-an-array-to-store-a-collection-of-data)

The below is an example of the simplest implementation of an array data structure. This is known as a _one-dimensional array_, meaning it only has one level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. Notice it contains _booleans_, _strings_, and _numbers_, among other valid JavaScript data types:

```js
let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three’, true, false, undefined, null];
console.log(simpleArray.length);
// logs 7
```

All array's have a length property, which as shown above, can be very easily accessed with the syntax `Array.length`.

A more complex implementation of an array can be seen below. This is known as a _multi-dimensional array_, or an array that contains other arrays. Notice that this array also contains JavaScript _objects_, which we will examine very closely in our next section, but for now, all you need to know is that arrays are also capable of storing complex objects.

```js
let complexArray = [
  [
    {
      one: 1,
      two: 2
    },
    {
      three: 3,
      four: 4
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      a: "a",
      b: "b"
    },
    {
      c: "c",
      d: “d”
    }
  ]
];
```

We have defined a variable called `yourArray`. Complete the statement by assigning an array of at least 5 elements in length to the `yourArray` variable. Your array should contain at least one _string_, one _number_, and one _boolean_.

## Setup
```js
let yourArray; // change this line
```

## Solution
```js
let yourArray = ['Genesis', 25, { month: 'February', day: 14, year: 1993 }, true, -1, 1.2];
```
