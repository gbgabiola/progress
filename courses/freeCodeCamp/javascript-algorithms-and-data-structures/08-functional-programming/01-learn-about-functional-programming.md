# [Functional Programming: Learn About Functional Programming](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/learn-about-functional-programming)

Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope.

`INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT`

Functional programming is about:

1) Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

2) Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

3) Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.

In the code editor, the `prepareTea` and `getTea` functions are already defined for you. Call the `getTea` function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the `tea4TeamFCC` variable.

## Setup
```js
/**
 * A long process to prepare tea.
 * @return {string} A cup of tea.
 **/
const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

/**
 * Get given number of cups of tea.
 * @param {number} numOfCups Number of required cups of tea.
 * @return {Array<string>} Given amount of tea cups.
 **/
const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];
  
  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }

  return teaCups;
};

// Add your code below this line
const tea4TeamFCC = null; // :(
// Add your code above this line

console.log(tea4TeamFCC);
```

## Solution
```js
/**
 * A long process to prepare tea.
 * @return {string} A cup of tea.
 **/
const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

/**
 * Get given number of cups of tea.
 * @param {number} numOfCups Number of required cups of tea.
 * @return {Array<string>} Given amount of tea cups.
 **/
const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];
  
  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }

  return teaCups;
};

const tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40);
console.log(tea4TeamFCC); // ["greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea", "greenTea"]
