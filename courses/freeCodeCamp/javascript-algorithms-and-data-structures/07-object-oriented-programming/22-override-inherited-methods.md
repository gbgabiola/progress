# [Object Oriented Programming: Override Inherited Methods](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/override-inherited-methods)

In previous lessons, you learned that an object can inherit its behavior (methods) from another object by cloning its `prototype` object:

```js
ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);
```

Then the `ChildObject` received its own methods by chaining them onto its `prototype`:

```js
ChildObject.prototype.methodName = function() {...};
```

It's possible to override an inherited method. It's done the same way - by adding a method to `ChildObject.prototype` using the same method name as the one to override.

Here's an example of `Bird` overriding the `eat()` method inherited from `Animal`:

```js
function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "nom nom nom";
};
function Bird() { }

// Inherit all methods from Animal
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Bird.eat() overrides Animal.eat()
Bird.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "peck peck peck";
};
```

If you have an instance `let duck = new Bird();` and you call `duck.eat()`, this is how JavaScript looks for the method on `duckâ€™s prototype` chain:

1. duck => Is eat() defined here? No.

2. Bird => Is eat() defined here? => Yes. Execute it and stop searching.

3. Animal => eat() is also defined, but JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.

4. Object => JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.

Override the `fly()` method for `Penguin` so that it returns "Alas, this is a flightless bird."

## Setup
```js
function Bird() { }

Bird.prototype.fly = function() { return "I am flying!"; };

function Penguin() { }
Penguin.prototype = Object.create(Bird.prototype);
Penguin.prototype.constructor = Penguin;

// Add your code below this line
// Add your code above this line

let penguin = new Penguin();
console.log(penguin.fly());
```

## Solution
```js
function Bird() { }

Bird.prototype.fly = function() { return "I am flying!"; };

function Penguin() { }
Penguin.prototype = Object.create(Bird.prototype);
Penguin.prototype.constructor = Penguin;

Penguin.prototype.fly = function() {
    return 'Alas, this is a flightless bird.';
}

let penguin = new Penguin();
console.log(penguin.fly()); // Alas, this is a flightless bird.
```
