# [Object Oriented Programming: Understand the Prototype Chain](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/understand-the-prototype-chain)

All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a `prototype`. Also, an objectâ€™s `prototype` itself is an object.

```js
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

typeof Bird.prototype; // => object
```

Because a `prototype` is an object, a `prototype` can have its own `prototype`! In this case, the `prototype` of `Bird.prototype` is `Object.prototype`:

```js
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Bird.prototype);
// returns true
```

How is this useful? You may recall the `hasOwnProperty` method from a previous challenge:

```js
let duck = new Bird("Donald");
duck.hasOwnProperty("name"); // => true
```

The `hasOwnProperty` method is defined in `Object.prototype`, which can be accessed by `Bird.prototype`, which can then be accessed by `duck`. This is an example of the `prototype` chain.

In this `prototype` chain, `Bird` is the `supertype` for `duck`, while `duck` is the `subtype`. `Object` is a `supertype` for both `Bird` and `duck`.

`Object` is a `supertype` for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the `hasOwnProperty` method.

Modify the code to show the correct prototype chain.

## Setup
```js
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);  // => true

// Fix the code below so that it evaluates to true
???.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype);
```

## Solution
```js
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);  // => true
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype); // true
```
