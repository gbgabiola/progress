# [Object Oriented Programming: Inherit Behaviors from a Supertype](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/inherit-behaviors-from-a-supertype)

In the previous challenge, you created a `supertype` called `Animal` that defined behaviors shared by all animals:

```js
function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  console.log("nom nom nom");
};
```

This and the next challenge will cover how to reuse `Animal's` methods inside `Bird` and `Dog` without defining them again. It uses a technique called `inheritance`.

This challenge covers the first step: make an instance of the `supertype` (or parent).

You already know one way to create an instance of `Animal` using the `new` operator:

```js
let animal = new Animal();
```

There are some disadvantages when using this syntax for `inheritance`, which are too complex for the scope of this challenge. Instead, here's an alternative approach without those disadvantages:

```js
let animal = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
```

`Object.create(obj)` creates a new object, and sets `obj` as the new object's `prototype`. Recall that the `prototype` is like the "recipe" for creating an object. By setting the `prototype` of `animal` to be `Animal's prototype`, you are effectively giving the `animal` instance the same "recipe" as any other instance of `Animal`.

```js
animal.eat(); // prints "nom nom nom"
animal instanceof Animal; // => true
```

---

Use `Object.create` to make two instances of `Animal` named `duck` and `beagle`.

## Setup
```js
function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal, 
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

// Add your code below this line

let duck; // Change this line
let beagle; // Change this line

duck.eat(); // Should print "nom nom nom"
beagle.eat(); // Should print "nom nom nom" 
```

## Solution
```js
function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal, 
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

let duck = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
let beagle = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

duck.eat(); // nom nom nom
beagle.eat(); // nom nom nom 
```
