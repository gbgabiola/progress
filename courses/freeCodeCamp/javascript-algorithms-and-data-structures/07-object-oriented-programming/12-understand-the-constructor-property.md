# [Object Oriented Programming: Understand the Constructor Property](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/understand-the-constructor-property)

There is a special `constructor` property located on the object instances `duck` and `beagle` that were created in the previous challenges:

```js
let duck = new Bird();
let beagle = new Dog();

console.log(duck.constructor === Bird); //prints true
console.log(beagle.constructor === Dog); //prints true
```

Note that the `constructor` property is a reference to the constructor function that created the instance.

The advantage of the `constructor` property is that it's possible to check for this property to find out what kind of object it is. Here's an example of how this could be used:

```js
function joinBirdFraternity(candidate) {
  if (candidate.constructor === Bird) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Note**  
Since the `constructor` property can be overwritten (which will be covered in the next two challenges) itâ€™s generally better to use the `instanceof` method to check the type of an object.

Write a `joinDogFraternity` function that takes a `candidate` parameter and, using the `constructor` property, return `true` if the candidate is a `Dog`, otherwise return `false`.

## Setup
```js
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Add your code below this line
function joinDogFraternity(candidate) {
  
}
```

## Solution
```js
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

function joinDogFraternity(candidate) {
  // if (candidate.constructor === Dog) {
  //   return true;
  // } else {
  //   return false;
  // }
  return candidate.constructor === Dog ? true : false;
}
```
