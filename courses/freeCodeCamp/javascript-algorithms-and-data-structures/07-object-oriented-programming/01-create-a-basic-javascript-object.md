# [Object Oriented Programming: Create a Basic JavaScript Object](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/create-a-basic-javascript-object)

Think about things people see everyday, like cars, shops, and birds. These are all `objects`: tangible things people can observe and interact with.

What are some qualities of these `objects`? A car has wheels. Shops sell items. Birds have wings.

These qualities, or `properties`, define what makes up an `object`. Note that similar `objects` share the same `properties`, but may have different values for those `properties`. For example, all cars have wheels, but not all cars have the same number of wheels.

`Objects` in JavaScript are used to model real-world objects, giving them `properties` and behavior just like their real-world counterparts. Here's an example using these concepts to create a `duck object`:

```js
let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
```

This `duck object` has two property/value pairs: a `name` of "Aflac" and a `numLegs` of 2.

---

Create a `dog object` with `name` and `numLegs` properties, and set them to a string and a number, respectively.

## Setup
```js
let dog = {
  
};
```

## Solution
```js
let dog = {
  name: 'Bruno',
  numLegs: 4
};
```
