# [Object Oriented Programming: Use a Mixin to Add Common Behavior Between Unrelated Objects](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/use-a-mixin-to-add-common-behavior-between-unrelated-objects)

As you have seen, behavior is shared through inheritance. However, there are cases when inheritance is not the best solution. Inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects like `Bird` and `Airplane`. They can both fly, but a `Bird` is not a type of `Airplane` and vice versa.

For unrelated objects, it's better to use `mixins`. A `mixin` allows other objects to use a collection of functions.

```js
let flyMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.fly = function() {
    console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
  }
};
```

The `flyMixin` takes any object and gives it the `fly` method.

```js
let bird = {
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2
};

let plane = {
  model: "777",
  numPassengers: 524
};

flyMixin(bird);
flyMixin(plane);
```

Here `bird` and `plane` are passed into `flyMixin`, which then assigns the `fly` function to each object. Now `bird` and `plane` can both fly:

```js
bird.fly(); // prints "Flying, wooosh!"
plane.fly(); // prints "Flying, wooosh!"
```

Note how the `mixin` allows for the same `fly` method to be reused by unrelated objects `bird` and `plane`.

Create a `mixin` named `glideMixin` that defines a method named `glide`. Then use the `glideMixin` to give both `bird` and `boat` the ability to glide.

## Setup
```js
let bird = {
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2
};

let boat = {
  name: "Warrior",
  type: "race-boat"
};

// Add your code below this line
```

## Solution
```js
let bird = {
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2
};

let boat = {
  name: "Warrior",
  type: "race-boat"
};


let glideMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.glide = function() {
      console.log('Gliding!');
  }
}

glideMixin(bird);
glideMixin(boat);
```
