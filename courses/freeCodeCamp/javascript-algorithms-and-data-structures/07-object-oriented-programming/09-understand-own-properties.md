# [Object Oriented Programming: Understand Own Properties](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/understand-own-properties)

In the following example, the `Bird` constructor defines two properties: `name` and `numLegs`:

```js
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
```

`name` and `numLegs` are called `own` properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. That means that `duck` and `canary` each has its own separate copy of these properties.

In fact every instance of `Bird` will have its own copy of these properties.

The following code adds all of the `own` properties of `duck` to the array `ownProps`:

```js
let ownProps = [];

for (let property in duck) {
  if(duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps); // prints [ "name", "numLegs" ]
```

---

Add the own properties of canary to the array ownProps.

## Setup
```js
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
let ownProps = [];
// Add your code below this line
```

## Solution
```js
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
let ownProps = [];

for (let property in canary) {
  if (canary.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}
```
