# [Regular Expressions: Match Single Characters Not Specified](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/match-single-characters-not-specified)

So far, you have created a set of characters that you want to match, but you could also create a set of characters that you do not want to match. These types of character sets are called `negated character sets`.

To create a `negated character set`, you place a `caret` character (`^`) after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match.

For example, `/[^aeiou]/gi` matches all characters that are not a vowel. Note that characters like `.`, `!`, `[`, `@`, `/` and white space are matched - the negated vowel character set only excludes the vowel characters.

Create a single regex that matches all characters that are not a number or a vowel. Remember to include the appropriate flags in the regex.

## Setup
```js
let quoteSample = "3 blind mice.";
let myRegex = /change/; // Change this line
let result = myRegex; // Change this line
```

## Solution
```js
let quoteSample = "3 blind mice.";
let myRegex = /[^aeiou^0-99]/ig;
let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex); // (9)Â [" ", "b", "l", "n", "d", " ", "m", "c", "."]
```
