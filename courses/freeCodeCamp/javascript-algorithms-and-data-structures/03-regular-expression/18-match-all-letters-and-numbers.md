# [Regular Expressions: Match All Letters and Numbers](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/match-all-letters-and-numbers)

Using character classes, you were able to search for all letters of the alphabet with `[a-z]`. This kind of character class is common enough that there is a shortcut for it, although it includes a few extra characters as well.

The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is `\w`. This shortcut is equal to `[A-Za-z0-9_]`. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. Note, this character class also includes the underscore character (`_`).

```js
let longHand = /[A-Za-z0-9_]+/;
let shortHand = /\w+/;
let numbers = "42";
let varNames = "important_var";
longHand.test(numbers); // Returns true
shortHand.test(numbers); // Returns true
longHand.test(varNames); // Returns true
shortHand.test(varNames); // Returns true
```

These shortcut character classes are also known as `shorthand character classes`.

Use the shorthand character class `\w` to count the number of alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.

## Setup
```js
let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let alphabetRegexV2 = /change/; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegexV2).length;
```

## Solution
```js
let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let alphabetRegexV2 = /\w/g;
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegexV2).length; // 31
```
