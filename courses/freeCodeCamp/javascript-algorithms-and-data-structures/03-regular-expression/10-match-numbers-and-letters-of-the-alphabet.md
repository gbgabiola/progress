# [Regular Expressions: Match Numbers and Letters of the Alphabet](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/match-numbers-and-letters-of-the-alphabet)

Using the hyphen (`-`) to match a range of characters is not limited to letters. It also works to match a range of numbers.

For example, `/[0-5]/` matches any number between `0` and `5`, including the `0` and `5`.

Also, it is possible to combine a range of letters and numbers in a single character set.

```js
let jennyStr = "Jenny8675309";
let myRegex = /[a-z0-9]/ig;
// matches all letters and numbers in jennyStr
jennyStr.match(myRegex);
```

Create a single regex that matches a range of letters between `h` and `s`, and a range of numbers between `2` and `6`. Remember to include the appropriate flags in the regex.

## Setup
```js
let quoteSample = "Blueberry 3.141592653s are delicious.";
let myRegex = /change/; // Change this line
let result = myRegex; // Change this line
```

## Solution
```js
let quoteSample = "Blueberry 3.141592653s are delicious.";
let myRegex = /[h-s2-6]/ig;
let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex); // (17) ["l", "r", "r", "3", "4", "5", "2", "6", "5", "3", "s", "r", "l", "i", "i", "o", "s"]
```
