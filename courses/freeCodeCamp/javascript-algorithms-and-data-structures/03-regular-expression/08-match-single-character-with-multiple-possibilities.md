# [Regular Expressions: Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/match-single-character-with-multiple-possibilities)

You learned how to match literal patterns (`/literal/`) and wildcard character (`/./`). Those are the extremes of regular expressions, where one finds exact matches and the other matches everything. There are options that are a balance between the two extremes.

You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. `Character classes` allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square (`[` and `]`) brackets.

For example, you want to match `"bag"`, `"big"`, and `"bug"` but not `"bog"`. You can create the regex `/b[aiu]g/` to do this. The `[aiu]` is the character class that will only match the characters `"a"`, `"i"`, or `"u"`.

```js
let bigStr = "big";
let bagStr = "bag";
let bugStr = "bug";
let bogStr = "bog";
let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;
bigStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns ["big"]
bagStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns ["bag"]
bugStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns ["bug"]
bogStr.match(bgRegex); // Returns null
```

Use a character class with vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) in your regex `vowelRegex` to find all the vowels in the string `quoteSample`.

**Note**  
Be sure to match both upper- and lowercase vowels.

## Setup
```js
let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
let vowelRegex = /change/; // Change this line
let result = vowelRegex; // Change this line
```

## Solution
```js
let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
let vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/ig;
let result = quoteSample.match(vowelRegex); // (25)Â ["e", "a", "e", "o", "u", "i", "e", "a", "o", "e", "o", "e", "I", "a", "e", "o", "o", "e", "i", "o", "e", "o", "i", "e", "i"]
```
