# [Regular Expressions: Match Whitespace](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/match-whitespace)

The challenges so far have covered matching letters of the alphabet and numbers. You can also match the whitespace or spaces between letters.

You can search for whitespace using `\s`, which is a lowercase `s`. This pattern not only matches whitespace, but also carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters. You can think of it as similar to the character class `[ \r\t\f\n\v]`.

```js
let whiteSpace = "Whitespace. Whitespace everywhere!"
let spaceRegex = /\s/g;
whiteSpace.match(spaceRegex);
// Returns [" ", " "]
```

---

Change the regex `countWhiteSpace` to look for multiple whitespace characters in a string.

## Setup
```js
let sample = "Whitespace is important in separating words";
let countWhiteSpace = /change/; // Change this line
let result = sample.match(countWhiteSpace);
```

## Solution
```js
let sample = "Whitespace is important in separating words";
let countWhiteSpace = /\s/g;
let result = sample.match(countWhiteSpace); // (5)Â [" ", " ", " ", " ", " "]
```
