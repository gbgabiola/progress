# [Debugging: Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging/catch-use-of-assignment-operator-instead-of-equality-operator)

Branching programs, i.e. ones that do different things if certain conditions are met, rely on `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements in JavaScript. The condition sometimes takes the form of testing whether a result is equal to a value.

This logic is spoken (in English, at least) as "if x equals y, then ..." which can literally translate into code using the `=`, or assignment operator. This leads to unexpected control flow in your program.

As covered in previous challenges, the assignment operator (`=`) in JavaScript assigns a value to a variable name. And the `==` and `===` operators check for equality (the triple `===` tests for strict equality, meaning both value and type are the same).

The code below assigns `x` to be 2, which evaluates as `true`. Almost every value on its own in JavaScript evaluates to `true`, except what are known as the "falsy" values: `false`, `0`, `""` (an empty string), `NaN`, `undefined`, and `null`.

```js
let x = 1;
let y = 2;
if (x = y) {
  // this code block will run for any value of y (unless y were originally set as a falsy)
} else {
  // this code block is what should run (but won't) in this example
}
```

Fix the condition so the program runs the right branch, and the appropriate value is assigned to `result`.

## Setup
```js
let x = 7;
let y = 9;
let result = "to come";

if(x = y) {
  result = "Equal!";
} else {
  result = "Not equal!";
}

console.log(result);
```

## Solution
```js
let x = 7;
let y = 9;
let result = "to come";

if(x == y) {
  result = "Equal!";
} else {
  result = "Not equal!";
}

console.log(result); // Not equal!
```
