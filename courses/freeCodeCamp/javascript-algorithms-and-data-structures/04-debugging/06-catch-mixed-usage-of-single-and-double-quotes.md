# [Debugging: Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging/catch-mixed-usage-of-single-and-double-quotes)

JavaScript allows the use of both single ('') and double ("") quotes to declare a string. Deciding which one to use generally comes down to personal preference, with some exceptions.

Having two choices is great when a string has contractions or another piece of text that's in quotes. Just be careful that you don't close the string too early, which causes a syntax error.

Here are some examples of mixing quotes:

```js
// These are correct:
const grouchoContraction = "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.";
const quoteInString = "Groucho Marx once said 'Quote me as saying I was mis-quoted.'";
// This is incorrect:
const uhOhGroucho = 'I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.';
```

Of course, it is okay to use only one style of quotes. You can escape the quotes inside the string by using the backslash (\) escape character:

```js
// Correct use of same quotes:
const allSameQuotes = 'I\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\'t it.';
```

---

Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the `href` value, or escape the existing ones. Keep the double quote marks around the entire string.

## Setup
```js
let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href="#Home">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml);
```

## Solution
```js
let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href=\"#Home\">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml); // <p>Click here to <a href="#Home">return home</a></p>
```

## Solution 2
```js
let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href='#Home'>return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml); // <p>Click here to <a href='#Home'>return home</a></p>
```
