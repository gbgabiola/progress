# [Align an Item Vertically using align-self](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-grid/align-an-item-vertically-using-align-self/)

Just as you can align an item horizontally, there's a way to align an item vertically as well. To do this, you use the `align-self` property on an item. This property accepts all of the same values as `justify-self` from the last challenge.

Align the item with the class `item3` vertically at the `end`.

## Solution

```css
.item3 {
  background: PaleTurquoise;

  align-self: end;
}
```
