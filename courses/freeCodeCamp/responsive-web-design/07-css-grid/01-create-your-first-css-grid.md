# [Create Your First CSS Grid](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-grid/create-your-first-css-grid)

Turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting its `display` property to `grid`. This gives you the ability to use all the other properties associated with CSS Grid.

**Note**  
In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as the _container_ and its children are called _items_.

---

Change the display of the div with the `container` class to `grid`.

## Solution

```css
.container {
  font-size: 40px;
  width: 100%;
  background: LightGray;
  
  display: grid;
}
```
