# [Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/adjust-the-width-of-an-element-using-the-width-property)

You can specify the width of an element using the `width` property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units (such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:

```css
img {
  width: 220px;
}
```

Add a `width` property to the entire card and set it to an absolute value of 245px. Use the `fullCard` class to select the element.

## Solution

```css
.fullCard {
  width: 245px;
}
```
