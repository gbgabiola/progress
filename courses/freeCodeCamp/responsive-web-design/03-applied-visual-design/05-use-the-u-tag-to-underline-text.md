# [Use the u Tag to Underline Text](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/use-the-u-tag-to-underline-text)

To underline text, you can use the `u` tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. With the `u` tag, the browser applies the CSS of `text-decoration: underline;` to the element.

---

Wrap the `u` tag only around the text "Ph.D. students".

**Note**  
Try to avoid using the `u` tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.
