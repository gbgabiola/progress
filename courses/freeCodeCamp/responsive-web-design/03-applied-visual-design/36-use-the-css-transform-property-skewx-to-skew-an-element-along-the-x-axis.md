# [Use the CSS Transform Property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/use-the-css-transform-property-skewx-to-skew-an-element-along-the-x-axis)

The next function of the `transform` property is `skewX()`, which skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.

The following code skews the paragraph element by -32 degrees along the X-axis.

```css
p {
  transform: skewX(-32deg);
}
```

Skew the element with the id of `bottom` by 24 degrees along the X-axis by using the `transform` property.

## Solution

```css
#bottom {
  background-color: blue;
  transform: skewX(24deg);
}
```
