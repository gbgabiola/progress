# [Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/create-a-horizontal-line-using-the-hr-element)

You can use the `hr` tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content.

---

Add an `hr` tag underneath the `h4` which contains the card title.

**Note**  
In HTML, `hr` is a self-closing tag, and therefore doesn't need a separate closing tag.

## Solution

```html
<h4><s>Google</s>Alphabet</h4>
<hr>
```
