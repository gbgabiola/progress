# [Set the line-height of Paragraphs](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/set-the-line-height-of-paragraphs)

CSS offers the `line-height` property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.

---

Add a `line-height` property to the `p` tag and set it to 25px.

## Solution

```css
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 25px;
}
```
