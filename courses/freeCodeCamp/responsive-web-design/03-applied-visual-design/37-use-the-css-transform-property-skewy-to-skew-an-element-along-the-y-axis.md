# [Use the CSS Transform Property skewY to Skew an Element Along the Y-Axis](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/use-the-css-transform-property-skewy-to-skew-an-element-along-the-y-axis)

Given that the `skewX()` function skews the selected element along the X-axis by a given degree, it is no surprise that the `skewY()` property skews an element along the Y (vertical) axis.

---

Skew the element with the id of `top` -10 degrees along the Y-axis by using the `transform` property.

## Solution

```css
#top {
  background-color: red;
  transform: skewY(-10deg);
}
```
