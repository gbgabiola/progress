# [Use the em Tag to Italicize Text](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/use-the-em-tag-to-italicize-text)

To emphasize text, you can use the `em` tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of `font-style: italic;` to the element.

Wrap an `em` tag around the contents of the paragraph tag to give it emphasis.
