# [Use display: flex to Position Two Boxes](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox/use-display-flex-to-position-two-boxes)

This section uses alternating challenge styles to show how to use CSS to position elements in a flexible way. First, a challenge will explain theory, then a practical challenge using a simple tweet component will apply the flexbox concept.

Placing the CSS property `display: flex;` on an element allows you to use other flex properties to build a responsive page.

Add the CSS property `display` to `#box-container` and set its value to flex.

## Solution

```css
#box-container {
  height: 500px;
  display: flex;
}
```
