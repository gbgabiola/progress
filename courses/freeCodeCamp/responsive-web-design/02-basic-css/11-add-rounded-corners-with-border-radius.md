# [Add Rounded Corners with border-radius](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/add-rounded-corners-with-border-radius)

Your cat photo currently has sharp corners. We can round out those corners with a CSS property called `border-radius`.

---

You can specify a `border-radius` with pixels. Give your cat photo a `border-radius` of `10px`.

Note: this challenge allows for multiple possible solutions. For example, you may add `border-radius` to either the `.thick-green-border` class or the `.smaller-image` class.

## Solution

```css
.thick-green-border {
  border-color: green;
  border-width: 10px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```
