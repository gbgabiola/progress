# [Set the Font Family of an Element](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/set-the-font-family-of-an-element)

You can set which font an element should use, by using the `font-family` property.

For example, if you wanted to set your `h2` element's font to `sans-serif`, you would use the following CSS:

```css
h2 {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

---

Make all of your `p` elements use the `monospace` font.

## Solution

```css
.red-text {
  color: red;
}

p {
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: monospace;
}
```
