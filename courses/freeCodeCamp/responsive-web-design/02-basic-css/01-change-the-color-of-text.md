# [Change the Color of Text](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/change-the-color-of-text)

Now let's change the color of some of our text.

We can do this by changing the `style` of your `h2` element.

The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the `color` style property.

Here's how you would set your `h2` element's text color to blue:

`<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>`

Note that it is a good practice to end inline `style` declarations with a `;`.

Change your `h2` element's style so that its text color is red.

```html
<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```
