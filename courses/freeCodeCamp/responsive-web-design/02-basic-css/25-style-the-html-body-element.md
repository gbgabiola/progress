# [Style the HTML Body Element](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/style-the-html-body-element)

Now let's start fresh and talk about CSS inheritance.

Every HTML page has a `body` element.

---

We can prove that the `body` element exists here by giving it a `background-color` of black.

We can do this by adding the following to our `style` element:

```css
body {
  background-color: black;
}
```

## Solution

```css
body {
  background-color: black;
}
```
