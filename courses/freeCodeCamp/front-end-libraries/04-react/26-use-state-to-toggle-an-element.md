# [React: Use State to Toggle an Element](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react/use-state-to-toggle-an-element)

You can use `state` in React applications in more complex ways than what you've seen so far. One example is to monitor the status of a value, then render the UI conditionally based on this value. There are several different ways to accomplish this, and the code editor shows one method.

---

`MyComponent` has a `visibility` property which is initialized to `false`. The render method returns one view if the value of `visibility` is true, and a different view if it is false.

Currently, there is no way of updating the `visibility` property in the component's `state`. The value should toggle back and forth between true and false. There is a click handler on the button which triggers a class method called `toggleVisibility()`. Define this method so the `state` of `visibility` toggles to the opposite value when the method is called. If `visibility` is `false`, the method sets it to `true`, and vice versa.

Finally, click the button to see the conditional rendering of the component based on its `state`.

**Hint:** Don't forget to bind the `this` keyword to the method in the constructor!

## Setup
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      visibility: false
    };
    // change code below this line

    // change code above this line
  }
  // change code below this line

  // change code above this line
  render() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
};
```

## Solution
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      visibility: false
    };
    this.toggleVisibility = this.toggleVisibility.bind(this);
  }
  toggleVisibility() {
    if (this.state.visibility == true) {
      this.setState({
        visibility: false
      });
    } else {
      this.setState({
        visibility: true
      });
    }
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
};
```
