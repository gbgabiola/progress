# [React: Render State in the User Interface Another Way](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react/render-state-in-the-user-interface-another-way)

There is another way to access `state` in a component. In the `render()` method, before the `return` statement, you can write JavaScript directly. For example, you could declare functions, access data from `state` or `props`, perform computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the `return` statement.

---

In the `MyComponent` render method, define a `const` called `name` and set it equal to the name value in the component's `state`. Because you can write JavaScript directly in this part of the code, you don't have to enclose this reference in curly braces.

Next, in the return statement, render this value in an `h1` tag using the variable `name`. Remember, you need to use the JSX syntax (curly braces for JavaScript) in the return statement.

## Setup
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    // change code below this line

    // change code above this line
    return (
      <div>
        { /* change code below this line */ }

        { /* change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Soluton
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    const name = this.state.name;
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```
