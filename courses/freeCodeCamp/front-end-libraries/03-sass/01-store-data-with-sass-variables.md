# [Sass: Store Data with Sass Variables](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/sass/store-data-with-sass-variables)

One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables. They are declared and set to store data, similar to JavaScript.

In JavaScript, variables are defined using the `let` and `const` keywords. In Sass, variables start with a `$` followed by the variable name.

Here are a couple examples:

```scss
$main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
$headings-color: green;

//To use variables:
h1 {
  font-family: $main-fonts;
  color: $headings-color;
}
```

One example where variables are useful is when a number of elements need to be the same color. If that color is changed, the only place to edit the code is the variable value.

Create a variable `$text-color` and set it to red. Then change the value of the `color` property for the `.blog-post` and `h2` to the `$text-color` variable.

## Setup
```html
<style type='text/sass'>
  
  .header{
    text-align: center;
  }
  .blog-post, h2 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h1 class="header">Learn Sass</h1>
<div class="blog-post">
  <h2>Some random title</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph with some random text in it</p>
</div>
<div class="blog-post">
  <h2>Header #2</h2>
  <p>Here is some more random text.</p>
</div>
<div class="blog-post">
  <h2>Here is another header</h2>
  <p>Even more random text within a paragraph</p>
</div>
```

## Solution
```scss
$text-color: red;

.blog-post, h2 {
  color: $text-color;
}
```
