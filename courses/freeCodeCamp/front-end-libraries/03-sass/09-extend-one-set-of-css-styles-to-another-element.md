# [Sass: Extend One Set of CSS Styles to Another Element](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/sass/extend-one-set-of-css-styles-to-another-element)

Sass has a feature called `extend` that makes it easy to borrow the CSS rules from one element and build upon them in another.

For example, the below block of CSS rules style a `.panel` class. It has a `background-color`, `height` and `border`.

```css
.panel{
  background-color: red;
  height: 70px;
  border: 2px solid green;
}
```

Now you want another panel called `.big-panel`. It has the same base properties as `.panel`, but also needs a `width` and `font-size`.

It's possible to copy and paste the initial CSS rules from `.panel`, but the code becomes repetitive as you add more types of panels.

The `extend` directive is a simple way to reuse the rules written for one element, then add more for another:

```scss
.big-panel{
  @extend .panel;
  width: 150px;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

The `.big-panel` will have the same properties as `.panel` in addition to the new styles.

Make a class `.info-important` that extends `.info` and also has a `background-color` set to magenta.

## Setup
```html
<style type='text/sass'>
  h3{
    text-align: center;
  }
  .info{
    width: 200px;
    border: 1px solid black;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  
</style>
<h3>Posts</h3>
<div class="info-important">
  <p>This is an important post. It should extend the class ".info" and have its own CSS styles.</p>
</div>

<div class="info">
  <p>This is a simple post. It has basic styling and can be extended for other uses.</p>
</div>
```

## Solution
```scss
.info-important {
  @extend .info;
  background-color: magenta;
}
```
