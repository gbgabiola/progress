# [Bootstrap: Create a Bootstrap Headline](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/bootstrap/create-a-bootstrap-headline)

Now let's build something from scratch to practice our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills.

We'll build a jQuery playground, which we'll soon put to use in our jQuery challenges.

To start with, create an `h3` element, with the text `jQuery Playground`.

Color your `h3` element with the `text-primary` Bootstrap class, and center it with the `text-center` Bootstrap class.

## Solution
```html
<h3 class="text-primary text-center">jQuery Playground</h3>
```
