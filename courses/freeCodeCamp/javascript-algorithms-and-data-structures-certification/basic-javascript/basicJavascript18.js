// Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction

/* Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5; */

// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;

a-=6;
b-=15;
c-=1;
