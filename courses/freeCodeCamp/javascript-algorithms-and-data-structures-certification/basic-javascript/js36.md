# [Basic JavaScript: Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/store-multiple-values-in-one-variable-using-javascript-arrays)

With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

`var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"]`.

---

Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a `string` and a `number` (in that order).

```js
var myArray = ["Genesis", 25];
```
