# [Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-multiplication/)

The `*=` operator multiplies a variable by a number.

`myVar = myVar * 5;`

will multiply `myVar` by `5`. This can be rewritten as:

`myVar *= 5;`

---

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `*=` operator.

```js
var a = 5;
var b = 12;
var c = 4.6;

a*=5;
b*=3;
c*=10;
```
