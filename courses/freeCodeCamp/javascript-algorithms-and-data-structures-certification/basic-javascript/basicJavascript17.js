// Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

/* In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;

to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator. */

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

a+= 12;
b+= 9;
c+= 7;
