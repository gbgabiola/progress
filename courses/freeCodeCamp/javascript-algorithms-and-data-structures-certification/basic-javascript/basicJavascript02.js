// Basic JavaScript: Declare JavaScript Variables

/* Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object. */
