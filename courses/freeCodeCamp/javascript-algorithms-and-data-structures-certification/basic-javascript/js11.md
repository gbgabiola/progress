# [Basic JavaScript: Increment a Number with JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/increment-a-number-with-javascript/)

You can easily _increment_ or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

`i++;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i + 1;`

**Note**  
The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.
