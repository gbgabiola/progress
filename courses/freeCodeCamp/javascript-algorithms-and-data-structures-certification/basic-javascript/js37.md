# [Basic JavaScript: Nest one Array within Another Array](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/nest-one-array-within-another-array)

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like this: `[["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]`. This is also called a `Multi-dimensional Array`.

Create a nested array called `myArray`.

```js
var myArray = [["David", 25], ["Moises", 30], ["Jesh", 29]];
```
