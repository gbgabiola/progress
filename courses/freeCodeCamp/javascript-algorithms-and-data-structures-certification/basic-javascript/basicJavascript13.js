/* We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

Note
Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. Details Here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems */
