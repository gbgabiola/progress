# [Basic JavaScript: Constructing Strings with Variables](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/constructing-strings-with-variables/)

Sometimes you will need to build a string, [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) style. By using the concatenation operator (`+`), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Set `myName` to a string equal to your name and build `myStr` with `myName` between the strings `"My name is "` and `" and I am well!"`

```js
var myName = "Genesis";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
```
