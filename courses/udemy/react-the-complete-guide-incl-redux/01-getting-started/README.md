# Getting Started

- React
  - A client-side JavaScript library
  - All about building modern, reactive user interfaces
  - Declarative, component-focused approach 
  - Traditional: web apps clicks link and wait for a new page to load
    - Click a button and wait for some action to complete
  - Nowadays, mobile and desktop apps happen instantly, no need to wait for new pages to load or actions to start
- SPA with React
  - Widget approach on a multi-page application
    - React can be used to _control parts_ of HTML pages or entire pages
    - Some pages are still_ rendered on and served by a backend server_
  - Single Page Applications (SPAs) approach
    - React can also be used to _control the entire frontend_ of a web application
    - Server _only sends one HTML page_, thereafter, React takes over and controls the UI
