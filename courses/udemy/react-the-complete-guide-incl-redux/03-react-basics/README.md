# React Basics & Working with Components

- React makes building _complex_, _interactive_ and _reactive_ user interaces _simpler_
- React is all about **Components** because all user interfaces are made up of components
  - Split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions
  - **Reusability**
    - Don't repeat yourself
  - **Separation of Concerns**
    - Don't do too many things in one and the same place (function)
- React allows us to create **re-usable and reactive components** consisting of **HTML and JavaScript** (and CSS)
- Uses a **Declarative** approach
  - Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions
- `package.json` holds the dependencies of the project like package names and versions
- JS can't `import` CSS but ReactJS can
- export fileA then import it into fileB
- `index.js` is usually or by default the main file of ReactJS
- `index.html` inside `public` folder is where the ReactJS will be rendered (inside the `div` with id `root`)
- JavaScript XML (**JSX**) is a HTML inside a JS code
- Component Tree
  - `<App />` which is rendered into single HTML page
    - `<Header />`
    - `<Tasks />`
      - `<Task />`
      - `<Task />`
      - `<Task />`
- Component naming convention is _Pascal_
- Lowercase elements are built-in HTML elements
- Uppercase elements are custom made by you or other developers
- Only one root element per return stateme or JSX code snippet
- `class` is `className` in ReactJS
- `{}` is used to pass a normal JS expression
- **Props** is like a parameter that can be used to pass data stored in other components
- Split components into multiple smaller components
- Components without attributes can be written as self-closing element 
- Composition is building a user interface from smaller building blocks
- Wrapper components are components that surround unknownn components and prove a default structure to display the child components
  - Extract code duplications into wrapper components
