## Todo List

- Instead of saying Weekend or Weekday, write out the full seven days.
  - If its Thursday, it should say `"It's Thursday"`
- Create a new form inside `list.ejs`
  - this form should have a text input that takes whatever value the user puts in there as the next to do list item
  - When you hit a submit button it's going to make a post request to the home route.
- Write some code that handles the post request to the home route, then console log the text that the user wrote into that input.
- Replace the line of code in the list item with a `for` loop using ejs tags
  - then loop through all of the items in the array and create a single `<li>` that contains every single item inside the array.
- Add the header and footer to the about page.
