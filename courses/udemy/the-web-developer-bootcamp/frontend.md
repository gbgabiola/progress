- Finding the Right Address
  - query is submitted to your ISP
  - from ISP, DNS takes the Domain name and
turns it into an IP address

  - server responds with HTML, CSS, and JS
- View Page Source
  - we can view the HTML, CSS, and JS on any webpage
  - every browsers have different ways to view page source
