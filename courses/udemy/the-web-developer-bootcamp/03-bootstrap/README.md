Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

We can use a single file of css and a single file of javaScript
All that is in bootstrap is a single file css and single file of javaScript, but a lot of css files and javaScript files in those 2 files, and we can include those 2 files on our application.

Taking someone else code from bootstrap and add to our own application, it helps us to make a good looking site, responsive and fast without much effort of coding it from scratch.
