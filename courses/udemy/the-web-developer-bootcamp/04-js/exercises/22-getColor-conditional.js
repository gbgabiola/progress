/**
 * In order to make your code repeatable and testable, I'm asking you to write your code inside a pre-defined function.
 *   - Write your code between the two comments in index.js
 *   - You will automatically have access to a variable called phrase.
 *     - Please do not try and define phrase or change phrase in any way!
 *     - I will be setting the value of phrase when I test your code.
 *   - Your job is to print out a color based upon the following rules:
 *     - if phrase is 'stop', you should print out 'red'
 *     - if phrase is 'slow', you should print out 'yellow'
 *     - if phrase is 'go', you should print out 'green'
 *     - if phrase is anything else, you should print out 'purple'
