 * In order to make your code repeatable and testable, I'm asking you to write your code inside a pre-defined function.
 *   - Write your code between the two comments in index.js.
 *   - You will automatically have access to a variable called num.
 *     - Please do not try and define num or change num in any way!
 *     - I will be setting the value of num when I test your code, so that I can test different outcomes.
 *   - If num is an even number, print out "even".
 *     - Don't do anything if num is an odd number.
