/**
 * I've provided you with a word variable set to "skateboard".
 * Your goal is to use string methods on word, so that you end up with the string "beard".
 *   1. Use a string method to extract the "board" part of "skateboard" (using the slice method)
 *   2. Replace the "o" in board with an "e" (using the replace method)
 *   3. Save the result in a variable called facialHair
