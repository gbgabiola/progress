/**
 * I've provided you with two variables, die1 and die2 which represent six-sided dice.
 * Each variable holds a randomly generated integer from 1 to 6.
 * Please create a new variable called roll, which will be a string that displays each die as well as their sum.
 * Follow this pattern:
 *   - die1: 3
 *   - die2: 5
 *   - roll: "You rolled a 3 and a 5. They sum to 8"
 *
 * Here is another example with different numbers
 *   - die1: 6
 *   - die2: 4
 *   - roll: "You rolled a 6 and a 4. They sum to 10"
 */

// NO TOUCHING! (please)
const die1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1; //random number from 1-6
const die2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1; //random number from 1-6

// YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE:
const roll = `You rolled a ${die1} and a ${die2}. They sum to ${die1 + die2}`;
