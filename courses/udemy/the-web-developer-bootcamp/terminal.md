## Why Learn Terminal

- **Speed** (Develop Faster)
  - The terminal takes some getting used to, but it can be MUCH faster than using a GUI
- **Access** (With Great Power...)
  - The terminal provides a _mainline_ into the heart of our computer, giving us access to areas we normally don't interact with
- **Tools**
  - Many of the tools we need are installed and used via the command line
  - We don't have much of a choice


## Terminologies

- **Terminal**
  - A text-based interface to your computer 
  - Originally a physical object, but now we use software terminals
- **Shell**
  - The program (software) running on the terminal
  - Analogy: The software running on the ATM (terminal) is the shell
- Command Line
- Console
- **Bash**
  - One of the most popular shells


## Terminal Commands

- **List** (`ls`) lists the contents of your current directory
- **Print Working Directory** (`pwd`) prints the path to the working directory (where you currently are)
- **Change Directory** (`cd`) changes and moves between folders
  - Use `cd ..` to _back up_ one directory
- **Touch** (`touch`) creates a file/s
- **Make Directory** (`mkdir`) creates a new directory (or directories)
- **rm** (`rm`) deletes (permanently) a file/s
  - `r` flag for recursive
  - `f` flag for force
  - `rm -rf` deletes a directory
