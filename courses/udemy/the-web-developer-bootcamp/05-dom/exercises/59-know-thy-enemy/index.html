<!--
In this exercise, I'm asking you to write some inline event handlers WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING I RECOMMEND, but hopefully it will illustrate to you just how annoying it can be.
In index.html, you'll find an <h1> element and a <button>.
Please add two inline click handlers directly in the html:
  - When the h1 is clicked, you should print "boo"
  - When the button is clicked, you should print "clicked"
-->
