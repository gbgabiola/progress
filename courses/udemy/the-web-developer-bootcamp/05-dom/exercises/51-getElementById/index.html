<!--
I've provided a little bit of markup for you (please don't change it!)
Your goal is to write code in app.js to select the following elements using getElementById:
  - Select the image element by its id and save it to a variable called image
  - Select the h1 by its id and save it to a variable called heading

Note: You may need to reset the code before attempting this exercise
