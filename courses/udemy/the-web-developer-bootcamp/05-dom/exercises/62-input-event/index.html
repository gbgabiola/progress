<!--
In the index.html file, you'll find an <h1> and an <input type="text"> element.
Please do not change anything in index.html!
In app.js, write code that meets these requirements:
  - The h1 should start with the text "Enter Your Username" (I've done that for you, already in the markup)
  - Whenever an  is fired on the <input> element, update the <h1> so that it displays "Welcome, " plus the current value from the text input.
    Take a look at the gif below to see how it should work.
  - If the <input> goes back to being empty, update the <h1> so that it once again says "Enter Your Username".
