<!--
I've provided you with an <h1> element which contains 7 individual spans (each holding a single letter).
  - Please write some JavaScript to make them rainbow-colored!
  - In app.js you'll find an array of color names called colors.
    - It looks like: ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet'].
  - Your task is to select all spans, iterate over them, and assign them each one of the colors from the colors array.
    - The first span should be red, the second should be orange, etc.
-->
