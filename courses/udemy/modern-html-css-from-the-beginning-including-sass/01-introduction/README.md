### Web Servers
- **Websites/Webpages** are files stored on computers that run a piece of software called a **web server** (Apache, Nginx, etc)

### Process Of Loading A Webpage
User search for google.com to a browser like Google Chrome or any other browsers, and the DNS looks for the domain names google.com and it maps it to the IP Address its needed. Once it gets the IP Address it then makes a HTTP request to the Web Server of that IP Address. And the Web Server will return a responsive with HTML, CSS, JS, images files and whatever else needed for google.com to be loaded on your browser.
