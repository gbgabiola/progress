# Investigating adding and appending to lists
# If you run the following four lines of codes, what are list1 and list2?

list1 = [1,2,3,4]
list2 = [1,2,3,4]

list1 = list1 + [5, 6]
list2.append([5, 6])

# to check, you can print them out using the print statements below.

print("showing list1 and list2:")
print(list1)
print(list2)

print (list1)
print (list2)

# What is the difference between these two pieces of code?

def proc(mylist):
    mylist = mylist + [6]

def proc2(mylist):
    mylist.append(6)

# Can you explain the results given by the four print statements below? Remove
# the hashes # and run the code to check.

print(list1)
proc(list1)
print(list1)

print(list2)
proc2(list2)
print(list2)

# Python has a special assignment syntax: +=.  Here is an example:

list3 = [1,2,3,4]
list3 += [5]

# Does this behave like list1 = list1 + [5] or list2.append(5)? Write a
# procedure, proc3 similar to proc and proc2, but for +=. When you've done
# that check your conclusion using the print-procedure call-print code as
# above.

# What happens when you try:

def proc3(mylist):
    mylist = mylist + [7,8,9]
def proc4(mylist):
    mylist.append([7,8,9])
def proc5(mylist):
    mylist += [7,8,9]

print(list1)
proc3(list1)
print(list1)

print(list2)
proc4(list2)
print(list2)

print(list3)
proc5(list3)
print(list3)

# When you've understood the difference between the three methods,
# write a procedure list_test which takes three lists as inputs. You should
# mutate the first input list to include 'a' as the last entry, mutate the
# second to include the entries 'a', 'b', 'c' and finally the last list should
# not be mutated but a copy should be returned with the additional entry 'w'.

def list_test(first_input, second_input, third_input):

    second_input += ['a', 'b', 'c']
    return third_input + ['w']

#>>> [1,2,3,'a']

#>>> [4,5,6,'a','b','c']
