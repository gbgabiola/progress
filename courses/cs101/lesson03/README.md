# Lesson 3 - How to Manage Data
Data - Learning to Crawl
- Indexing on a lists and strings
- Nested lists.
- differences of lists and strings
- Mutation - is that you can change the value of the list after it was created.
  - lists is mutable, String is immutable
  - list is a set of anything, strings is a set of characters
  - Aliasing
  - `.append()` - adding a new element at the end of the list
  - `+` - works like concatenation
  - `len()` short for length, produces an output a number of length of the list
- How Computers Store Data
  - capacitor
  - DRAM
  - latency - time to retrive a value
  - cost
  - memory hierarchy
- Loops of Lists
  - for loops and while loops
- `.index()` method
- `in` operator, `not in` can be use also
- `.pop()` operator - mutate the list by removing and returning its last element
