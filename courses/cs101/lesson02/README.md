# Lesson 2 - Write Programs to do Repeating Work

## How to Repeat - Procedures and Controls

- 2 Concepts of Computer Science:
  - Procedures - are way to package code so we can reuse it easily
  - Controls - a way to make a decisions and do the repetitions
- Sum procedure with a return statement.
- Equality comparisons and more.
  - Difference between Equality (`==`) and Assignment (`=`) Operator.
  - if else statement
  - OR expression
    - if the first expression evaluates to `True`, the value is `True` and the second expression is not evaluated.
    - If the first expression evaluates to `False`, the value is the value of the second expression.
- Construct Loops
  - while loops
  - beware of infinite loop
  - break statement - it's a way to stop the loop even while condition is True

- How to Solve Problmes
  - Practice Problems
  - Draw General lessons
  - Understanding a Problem (Computational)
  - Problem is defined by
    - possible inputs (set)
    - relationship between inputs -> outputs
  - Algorithm Pseudocode

  0. Don't Panic!
  1. What are the inputs?
  2. How are the outputs?
  3. Work through some examples by hand
  4. Simple mechanical Solution
  5. Develop incrementally and test as we go
