# Back-End Web Development

## Goal

- Explore the components of back-end development, working with an MVC framework
- Apply concepts like data types, objects, methods, object-oriented programming, and classes in the context of backend development.
- Server-Side JavaScript
- Using Node on the command line
- NPM
- JavaScript Build Processes
- Event Loop and Emitters
- File System Interaction
- Modules
- Native Node drivers

Full Stack = Front-End + Back-End

Back-End Development consist of:

1. Server
2. Database
3. Application

Web Application doesn't just display information, it also has functionality on the backend that enables it to do something concrete.

Restaurant Analogy for a Full Stack Web Application:

- FRONT OF HOUSE restaurant is basically the client side. It's what the user sees in the the browser. They're able to interact with the website using JavaScript and able to see the information that's being displayed using HTML and CSS.
- Kitchen is the place where all the dishes gets served from. So when a restaurant goer ask for for a Philly steal then that order gets sent to the server and the server should send it back.
- Larder is where all the ingredients are stored which is the database.


Take our ingredients from the database so the server interacts with the database, then execute some code on the server and create the application/dish. It is gets served to the client side.

Some of the Back-end Programming Language technologies:

- PHP
- Ruby
- Java
- Node.js

Some of the Frameworks to speed up the development:

- cake PHP
- Ruby on Rails
- sprint
- Express
